# RubyDev SIFT — Quality Assessment Protocol

## Overview

This skill provides **comprehensive quality assessment** using the SIFT Protocol V1.0. SIFT evaluates four dimensions (Structure, Idioms, Functionality, Testing) with Toulmin evidence framework and produces actionable reports in four modes. This skill embodies "The Pragmatist" persona: analytical, holistic, and evidence-driven.

**SIFT Acronym**:
- **S**tructure: Zeitwerk compliance, file organization, architecture. Ground findings in named OOD principles (TRUE, SRP, dependency direction, composition bias) from `../ruby-dev/references/ood-principles.md` — a structure finding without a named principle as its warrant is an opinion, not evidence. Include a **portability constants sweep**: grep for hardcoded dimensions (embedding sizes, column widths), absolute/user-specific paths, magic hosts/ports, and pinned model names — each is a place the code breaks when moved to another machine, model, or dataset. Cheap to check, disproportionately often missed when the audit goes deep on architecture.
- **I**dioms: Ruby best practices, convention adherence, readability
- **F**unctionality: Logic correctness, error handling, edge cases
- **T**esting: Coverage, test quality, maintainability. Judge against the Testing Grid (incoming: assert result; outgoing command: mock; outgoing query: ignore) in `../ruby-dev/references/ood-principles.md`.

---

## Project Setup

### Gemfile

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

source "https://rubygems.org"

# Type Safety
gem "dry-struct"
gem "dry-types"

# Logging
gem "journald-logger"

# Autoloading
gem "zeitwerk"

group :development, :test do
  gem "rubocop"
  gem "simplecov"
  gem "pry"
  gem "pry-byebug"
  gem "rspec"
end
```

### Assessment Types (dry-struct)

Assessment results use type-safe dry-struct types (`DimensionScore`, `AssessmentResult`, `Finding`, `TechAdvisory`) rather than raw hashes. See [references/assessment-types.md](references/assessment-types.md) for the complete definitions.

## When to Use

- **Quality assessment**: "Review this project and tell me what's wrong"
- **Pre-merge review**: Before accepting a large PR or refactor
- **Architectural review**: Evaluating design decisions in a codebase
- **Tech advisory**: "Is this production-ready?"
- **Backlog generation**: Converting findings into prioritized work items
- **Post-refactor validation**: Confirming improvements met standards

**Don't use for:**
- **Root cause debugging** (use [analyse/SKILL.md](../analyse/SKILL.md) instead)
- **Direct code generation** (use the [ruby-dev orchestrator](../ruby-dev/SKILL.md))
- **Simple linting** (use `rubocop` directly)
- **Performance profiling** (use `ruby-prof` or `stackprof`)

## Report Modes

### Mode 1: Full Report (Default)

**Trigger**: "Review this project", "SIFT this codebase", "Full quality assessment"

**Output**: 8-section comprehensive report with weighted scores

**Sections**:
1. **Executive Summary**: High-level findings and overall score
2. **Structure Assessment**: Zeitwerk compliance, file organization, namespace design
3. **Idiom Analysis**: Ruby best practices, convention adherence, readability
4. **Functionality Review**: Logic correctness, error handling, edge case coverage
5. **Testing Evaluation**: Coverage metrics, test quality, maintainability
6. **Quantified Impact**: File:line references, estimated remediation time
7. **Prioritized Recommendations**: Ordered by severity and impact
8. **Verification Footer** (optional): SADD-integrated verification if in do-and-judge loop

**Scoring**:
```
Overall Score = (Structure × 0.25) + (Idioms × 0.20) + (Functionality × 0.35) + (Testing × 0.20)

Score Bands:
- 90-100: Production-ready
- 75-89: Good, minor improvements needed
- 60-74: Functional but requires refactoring
- Below 60: Significant issues, not recommended for production
```

### Mode 2: System Design Review

**Trigger**: "Architectural review", "Design review", "Is this architecture sound?"

**Focus**: Structure and high-level design patterns only

**Sections**:
1. **Architecture Overview**: Layer diagram, module dependencies
2. **Design Patterns**: Identified patterns (Strategy, Factory, Observer, etc.)
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Coupling analysis, dependency direction
4. **Extensibility**: How easy to add new features
5. **Technical Debt**: Structural issues requiring refactoring
6. **Recommendations**: Prioritized by architectural impact

**Scoring**: Structure dimension only (0-100)

### Mode 3: Tech Advisory

**Trigger**: "Is this production-ready?", "Tech advisory", "Should we deploy this?"

**Focus**: Risk assessment with binary recommendations

**Sections**:
1. **Verdict**: GO / NO-GO with rationale
2. **Critical Blockers**: Issues that must be fixed before deployment
3. **Risk Assessment**: Security, performance, maintainability risks
4. **Deployment Checklist**: Pre-flight checks
5. **Monitoring Recommendations**: What to watch in production
6. **Rollback Plan**: How to revert if issues surface

**Scoring**: Risk-weighted composite (Security × 0.4, Functionality × 0.3, Testing × 0.3)

### Mode 4: Backlog

**Trigger**: "Generate backlog items", "Convert findings to tickets"

**Focus**: Actionable work items with estimates

**Output**: Markdown checklist formatted as GitHub/Linear issues:
```markdown
## High Priority (Must Fix)
- [ ] **Zeitwerk NameError**: Rename `lib/app/data_processor.rb` → `lib/app/data/processor.rb` [1h]
- [ ] **Missing error handling**: Wrap external API calls in circuit breaker [2h]

## Medium Priority (Should Fix)
- [ ] **Dead code**: Remove unused `ReportGenerator` class (no callers) [30m]
- [ ] **Test coverage**: Add tests for `PaymentProcessor#refund` (0% coverage) [3h]

## Low Priority (Nice to Have)
- [ ] **Readability**: Extract 150-line method into smaller units [4h]
- [ ] **Documentation**: Add YARD docs for public API [2h]
```

## Toulmin Evidence Framework

Every SIFT finding follows the Toulmin argumentation model:

```
[CLAIM] → [DATA] → [WARRANT] → [BACKING] → [QUALIFIER] → [REBUTTAL]
```

**Example**:
```markdown
### Finding: Zeitwerk Naming Violation

**Claim**: File `lib/app/data_processor.rb` violates Zeitwerk naming convention.

**Data**: 
- File path: `lib/app/data_processor.rb`
- Expected constant: `App::DataProcessor`
- Actual constant: `App::Data::Processor` (nested)

**Warrant**: Zeitwerk requires file paths to mirror constant nesting. Nested constants need nested directories.

**Backing**: 
- Zeitwerk docs: "A file is expected to define a constant whose name matches the basename" (https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk#file-structure)
- Running `zeitwerk:check` raises `Zeitwerk::NameError`

**Qualifier**: This will cause runtime errors in production if the constant is autoloaded.

**Rebuttal**: If the codebase uses classic autoloading (`require` statements), this is not an issue. However, Ruby 3.x+ defaults to Zeitwerk.

**Severity**: **Critical** (runtime error)
**Remediation**: Rename to `lib/app/data/processor.rb` [5 minutes]
```

## SIFT Dimensions

### Structure (Weight: 0.25)

**What**: File organization, namespace design, architectural layers

**Checks**:
- [ ] **Zeitwerk compliance**: All constants match file paths
- [ ] **Autoload paths**: Configured correctly in `config/` or project root
- [ ] **Namespace pollution**: No top-level constants (except entry point)
- [ ] **Directory structure**: Logical grouping (models/, services/, lib/)
- [ ] **Circular dependencies**: No A → B → A cycles
- [ ] **Configuration management**: Secrets in ENV, not committed
- [ ] **Gemfile organization**: Groups (development, test, production) present

**Scoring Example**:
```
Total checks: 7
Passed: 5
Score: (5 / 7) × 100 = 71.4
```

### Idioms (Weight: 0.20)

**What**: Ruby best practices, convention adherence, readability

**Checks**:
- [ ] **Frozen string literal**: Present on all files
- [ ] **Keyword arguments**: Preferred over positional (Ruby 3+)
- [ ] **Module function**: Preferred over `extend self`
- [ ] **Struct initialization**: `keyword_init: true` used
- [ ] **Refinements**: Used for monkey-patching (not reopening classes)
- [ ] **Enumerable methods**: Preferred over manual loops (`map` vs `each` + push)
- [ ] **Safe navigation**: `&.` used for nil-safe calls
- [ ] **Symbol-to-proc**: `&:method_name` shorthand used
- [ ] **Multi-line blocks**: `do...end` for multi-line, `{...}` for one-line
- [ ] **Method length**: <25 lines per method (median)
- [ ] **Variable hoisting in hot loops**: Repeated `@ivar` reads or no-arg method calls (`attr_reader`s, `size`, etc.) inside loops that run thousands+ times are hoisted into a local before the loop, not re-looked-up on every iteration

**Rubocop Integration**: Run `rubocop --format json` and parse offenses.

### Functionality (Weight: 0.35)

**What**: Logic correctness, error handling, edge cases

**Checks**:
- [ ] **Error handling**: `rescue` blocks present for external calls
- [ ] **Circuit breakers**: Wrapping external APIs (HTTP, DB, Redis)
- [ ] **Nil checks**: Explicit handling of nil values
- [ ] **Type coercion**: Safe conversions (`to_i` with fallback)
- [ ] **Edge cases**: Empty arrays, zero values, boundary conditions handled
- [ ] **Idempotency**: Repeated calls produce same result (where applicable)
- [ ] **Transaction safety**: DB operations wrapped in transactions
- [ ] **Async execution**: Blocking I/O moved to `Async {}` blocks
- [ ] **Resource cleanup**: `ensure` blocks for file/socket closure
- [ ] **Logging**: Structured logs with context (not just strings)

**Highest Weight**: Functionality is 35% of overall score because correctness matters most.

### Testing (Weight: 0.20)

**What**: Test coverage, test quality, maintainability

**Checks**:
- [ ] **Coverage threshold**: >80% line coverage (run `simplecov`)
- [ ] **Test framework**: RSpec or Minitest present
- [ ] **Unit tests**: Public methods have test coverage
- [ ] **Integration tests**: Happy path and error path tested
- [ ] **Test isolation**: No shared state between tests
- [ ] **Test speed**: <5 seconds for unit suite, <60 seconds for full suite
- [ ] **Test readability**: Descriptive names, clear assertions
- [ ] **Fixtures**: Factories or fixtures for test data
- [ ] **Mocking**: External dependencies mocked (HTTP, DB)
- [ ] **CI integration**: Tests run on every commit

**Coverage Extraction**:
```ruby
require "simplecov"
SimpleCov.start

# After running tests:
coverage_data = SimpleCov.result
line_coverage = coverage_data.covered_percent # → 87.4
```

## Integration with Other Skills

### From the ruby-dev Orchestrator (Audit Gate)

The [ruby-dev orchestrator](../ruby-dev/SKILL.md) uses SIFT as its primary quality check within the pipeline:

1. **Survey**: Codebase overview (orchestrator entry survey)
2. **Evaluation**: Run this skill (audit gate)
3. **Recommendations**: Generate backlog (self-correction loop)

### Receiving Findings (Input-Driven)

SIFT evaluates whatever findings it receives, making it agnostic to the source:

- **From [analyse/SKILL.md](../analyse/SKILL.md)** — analyse produces `AnalysisSession` findings. SIFT evaluates whether those findings have been resolved.
- **From the orchestrator (Audit Gate)** — the ruby-dev orchestrator calls SIFT for the quality check within its pipeline.
- **From the orchestrator (do-and-judge)** — rubric + code. SIFT evaluates against the rubric.

**Pattern**: [Any source produces findings] → SIFT evaluates → Score + recommendations

### With Do-and-Judge Loop

When called by the [ruby-dev orchestrator](../ruby-dev/SKILL.md) in a do-and-judge loop:

1. **Meta-Judge** generates pre-evaluation rubric (YAML)
2. **Builder** produces code
3. **SIFT** evaluates against rubric
4. If score < threshold: Builder retries with feedback
5. Loop until passing or max retries

**SADD Verification Footer** (added in do-and-judge mode):
```markdown
---
## SADD Verification

**Iteration**: 2 of 3
**Previous Score**: 68.2
**Current Score**: 84.7
**Threshold**: 75.0
**Status**: PASS

**Improvements Made**:
- Added circuit breakers to external API calls (+8 points)
- Fixed Zeitwerk naming violations (+5 points)
- Increased test coverage from 45% to 82% (+15 points)
```

## One-Shot Recipes

### Recipe 1: Quick Quality Check

**User Request**: "Is this code good?"

```
Assess lib/my_app/processor.rb
```

**Process**:
1. Run SIFT Full Report (default mode)
2. Score all four dimensions
3. Generate prioritized recommendations
4. Output overall score: 78.3 → "Good, minor improvements needed"

### Recipe 2: Pre-Deployment Review

**User Request**: "Can we deploy this to production?"

```
Assess --mode=tech-advisory
```

**Process**:
1. Focus on risk assessment
2. Check for critical blockers:
   - Secrets in code? ❌
   - Test coverage >80%? ✅
   - Error handling present? ✅
   - Circuit breakers for external calls? ❌ (BLOCKER)
3. Verdict: **NO-GO** until circuit breakers added

### Recipe 3: Backlog Generation

**User Request**: "Convert these findings into GitHub issues"

```
Assess --mode=backlog --output=github-issues.md
```

**Process**:
1. Run full assessment
2. Group findings by priority (High/Medium/Low)
3. Add time estimates based on complexity
4. Output markdown checklist compatible with GitHub/Linear

## Failover

| Dependency | If Unavailable | Fallback |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| No input findings provided | Caller didn't supply findings | Accept findings as structured input from the caller. If none arrive, run assessment using only the code surface — Structure and Idioms from direct inspection, Functionality from file-level analysis, Testing from test file presence. |
| [ruby-dev orchestrator](../ruby-dev/SKILL.md) | Orchestrator not driving a do-and-judge loop | Run SIFT as a single-pass evaluation. Output the score with recommendations but without the iteration rubric or SADD Verification Footer. The caller can trigger a re-evaluation manually. |
| Do-and-Judge loop | Builder fails mid-loop | Output partial results with [`WARNING: Partial Assessment`] marking and include which iterations completed versus failed. |

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Skipping the survey phase.** Jumping straight to scoring without understanding the codebase context yields meaningless scores.
2. **Ignoring the evidence rubric.** Each dimension score must be backed by specific evidence, not gut feeling.
3. **Treating all findings as equal.** Use Toulmin's **severity qualifier** to prioritize critical vs. nice-to-have.
4. **Ignoring test quality.** 100% coverage with bad tests is worse than 60% with good tests. Assess test **quality**, not just quantity.
5. **Over-focusing on idioms.** A readable codebase with broken logic is still broken. Functionality weight (35%) > Idioms weight (20%).
6. **Not providing file:line references.** Vague findings ("error handling is missing") aren't actionable. Cite specific locations.
7. **Skipping the rebuttal.** Toulmin's rebuttal acknowledges when a finding might not apply (e.g., "unless you're using classic autoloading").
8. **Generating reports no one reads.** Backlog mode converts findings into actionable tickets. Use it.
9. **Not tracking improvements.** In do-and-judge loops, include the SADD verification footer to show progress.
